CMake
=====

This repository is not yet integrated with libbitcoin's build system.

For now, use the cmake build process:

```
cd builds/cmake
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=true -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path_to_libbitcoin_libs> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_prefix> -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=<path_to_your_boost_installation> .
make
make test
```

TODO (kp): Add `make install` instructions.
